Constantly monitors the folder checker.py is running in to see if any current files are altered, changed, and how long they were changed for in case of intruders trying to put back original file/hash, it will let you know how long the file was compromised

## Usage

   python checker.py
```
Use Ctrl+C to stop; otherwise will constantly monitor the folder it's in, watch it as you add files, alter files, change files, and return them to normal
